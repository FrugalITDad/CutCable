🔧 Why This Exists
As a frugal IT dad, I built this to make it easy for my loved ones to:

Cut the cable cord 💸

Access reliable streaming 🖥️📺

Avoid constant tech support calls 😅

With this setup, you’ll always have the latest version without needing to reinstall everything manually.

🚀 First-Time Setup

Use the Wizard URL in Kodi to install the build.

Choose your version:

With Plex (for media servers)

Without Plex (for pure streaming)

A first-run setup will guide you through:
